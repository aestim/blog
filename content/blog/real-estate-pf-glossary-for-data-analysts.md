# [Glossary] Essential Real Estate PF Terms for Data Analysts

For a data analyst, the ability to influence business decisions starts with mastering the "language of the domain." In the world of **Real Estate Project Financing (PF)**, the data is only as good as the analyst's understanding of the underlying financial structures.

Based on my current experience in the real estate development sector, I have compiled a glossary of essential terms. These are the building blocks I use to model risks for projects like the **Geomdan P2-Ju Parking Tower**.

### 1. Funding & Cost Structures

Understanding how a project is funded is the first step in identifying financial bottlenecks.

- **PF (Project Financing)**: A method of funding a project based on its projected cash flow rather than the developer's general balance sheet.
- **Equity**: The developer's own capital invested in the project. In our current modeling, identifying the impact of an **equity shortfall** (e.g., a 1.75B KRW gap) is a critical stress test.
- **Bridge Loan**: A short-term, high-interest loan used to cover initial costs like land acquisition before permanent PF is secured.
- **All-in Cost**: The total effective interest rate, including the nominal rate and all upfront fees.
- **Spread**: The additional interest rate added to a base rate (like the CD 91-day rate) to reflect the specific risk profile of the project.

### 2. Valuation & Return Metrics

These metrics are the "North Star" for any data-driven valuation model.

- **NOI (Net Operating Income)**: Total annual income from rent and parking minus operating expenses (excluding taxes and interest).
- **Cap Rate (Capitalization Rate)**: The ratio of NOI to the property’s value ($Value = \frac{NOI}{Cap Rate}$). It represents the market's required rate of return.
- **Percentage Rent**: A lease structure where rent is calculated as a percentage of the tenant's gross sales. For example, our **E-mart** contract is modeled at **4.5% of total sales**.
- **Anchor Tenant**: A high-profile tenant (like E-mart) that ensures stable traffic and significantly reduces the risk profile of the asset.

### 3. Risk & Exit Strategy

These terms define the "breaking points" of a project.

- **LTV (Loan to Value)**: The ratio of the loan amount to the property's appraised value. When an asset is valued at **190B KRW** against a **230B KRW PF**, the LTV exceeds 100%, signaling a critical default risk.
- **DSCR (Debt Service Coverage Ratio)**: A measure of the project's ability to cover its debt payments using its net income.
- **Negative Carry**: A situation where the cost of debt (interest) exceeds the income generated by the asset—a common risk during the gap between completion and full occupancy.
- **Refinancing**: Replacing high-interest PF debt with lower-interest permanent loans once the project is stabilized (e.g., after the opening of the **Incheon District Court** in 2028).
- **EOD (Event of Default)**: A specific breach of contract (like an equity shortfall or interest arrears) that allows lenders to demand immediate repayment.

### Conclusion

Mastering these terms allows a data analyst to move beyond simple data processing and become a **strategic partner** in the decision-making process. By quantifying these variables, we can transform abstract risks into actionable insights.

In my next post, I will demonstrate how to use these terms to build a **Sensitivity Analysis Model** to predict how fluctuations in interest rates and Cap Rates impact the final ROI of a development project.
