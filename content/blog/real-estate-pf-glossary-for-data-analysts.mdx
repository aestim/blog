For a data analyst moving into real estate development, mastering the domain's vocabulary is the first step toward building meaningful models. Here is a summary of the essential terms used in project feasibility studies.

### 1. Funding & Capital Structure

* **Project Financing (PF)**: Funding a project based on its future cash flow rather than the developer's current credit. 
* **Equity**: The developer's own capital committed to the project.
* **Bridge Loan**: Short-term, high-interest financing used until permanent PF is secured.

### 2. Operational Performance & Valuation

These metrics help us understand how much an asset is worth based on its income-generating potential.

* **NOI (Net Operating Income)**: The total annual income generated by a property minus operating expenses.
* **Cap Rate (Capitalization Rate)**: The market's required rate of return.

$$
\text{Asset Value} = \frac{\text{NOI}}{\text{Cap Rate}}
$$

### 3. Risk & Leverage Metrics

As an analyst, these ratios are the "red flags" we monitor to ensure the project remains solvent.

* **LTV (Loan to Value)**: The ratio of the total loan amount to the appraised value.
* **DSCR (Debt Service Coverage Ratio)**: Measures the ability to cover debt obligations using NOI.

$$
\text{LTV} = \frac{\text{Total Loan}}{\text{Appraised Value}} \times 100
$$

$$
\text{DSCR} = \frac{\text{NOI}}{\text{Annual Debt Service}}
$$

### 4. Revenue Structures

* **Anchor Tenant**: A major tenant that stabilizes the project traffic.
* **Percentage Rent**: A lease where rent is tied to the tenant's gross sales.

$$
\text{Total Rent} = \max(\text{Base Rent}, \text{Gross Sales} \times \text{Rate})
$$

### Conclusion

Mastering these terms is essential for translating complex real estate dynamics into data-driven insights. In future posts, I will apply these definitions to a Python-based sensitivity분석.
