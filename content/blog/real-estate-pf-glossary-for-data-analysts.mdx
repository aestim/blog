For a data analyst, influencing business decisions starts with mastering the "language of the domain." In the world of **Real Estate Project Financing (PF)**, the data is only as good as the analyst's understanding of the underlying financial structures.

Using my current experience in the real estate development sector, combined with a technical background in Informatics, I have compiled a glossary of essential terms. These are the building blocks I use to model risks for projects like the **Geomdan P2-Ju Parking Tower**.

### 1. Funding & Cost Structures

Understanding how a project is funded is the first step in identifying financial bottlenecks.

- **PF (Project Financing)**: A method of funding a project based on its projected cash flow rather than the developer's general balance sheet.
- **Equity**: The developer's own capital invested in the project. In current modeling, identifying the impact of an **equity shortfall** is a critical stress test.
- **Bridge Loan**: A short-term, high-interest loan used to cover initial costs before permanent PF is secured.
- **All-in Cost**: The total effective interest rate, including the nominal rate and all upfront fees.
- **Spread**: The additional interest rate added to a base rate to reflect the specific risk profile of the project.

### 2. Valuation & Return Metrics

These metrics serve as the "North Star" for any data-driven valuation model.

- **NOI (Net Operating Income)**: Total annual income from rent and parking minus operating expenses, excluding taxes and interest.
- **Cap Rate (Capitalization Rate)**: The ratio of NOI to the property’s value, representing the market's required rate of return.

$$\text{Asset Value} = \frac{\text{NOI}}{\text{Cap Rate}}$$

- **Percentage Rent**: A lease structure where rent is a percentage of gross sales, such as the **E-mart** contract modeled at **4.5%**.
- **Anchor Tenant**: A high-profile tenant (like E-mart) that ensures stable traffic and reduces the risk profile.

### 3. Risk & Exit Strategy

These terms define the "breaking points" of a project's financial health.

- **LTV (Loan to Value)**: The ratio of the loan amount to the property's appraised value.
- **DSCR (Debt Service Coverage Ratio)**: A measure of the project's ability to cover its debt payments using its net income.
- **Negative Carry**: A situation where interest costs exceed the income generated by the asset.
- **Refinancing**: Replacing high-interest PF debt with lower-interest loans once the project is stabilized, such as after the **Incheon District Court** opens in 2028.
- **EOD (Event of Default)**: A specific breach of contract that allows lenders to demand immediate repayment.

### Conclusion

Mastering these terms allows a data analyst to move beyond simple data processing and become a **strategic partner**. By quantifying these variables, we can transform abstract risks into actionable insights.

In my next post, I will demonstrate how to build a **Sensitivity Analysis Model** using Python to predict how fluctuations in interest rates impact the final ROI.
